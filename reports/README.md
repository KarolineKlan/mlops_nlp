# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustive* which means that it includes everything that you could do on the project included in the
curriculum in this course. Therefore, we do not expect at all that you have checked all boxes at the end of the project.
The parenthesis at the end indicates what module the bullet point is related to. Please be honest in your answers, we
will check the repositories and the code to verify your answers.

### Question 3
> **A requirement to the project is that you include a third-party package not covered in the course. What framework**
> **did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

We used the transformers package from hugging face to do preprocessing on our data. More specifically we used the "distilbert-base-uncased" model including the appropriate tokenizer to create embeddings of the text data. These embeddings were then saved in the "data/processed" directory. Using this model to get embeddings of the text from the IMDb dataset enable to effectively capture the semantic meaning of the text and this made it possible to make a very simple classifier with only two layers and still get a fairly high accuracy score. Furthermore, the use of pre-trained models significantly reduced the computational resources and time required for training leaving us to focus more on the implementations of the MLOps related stuff.




## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment. This includes
> how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

We use requirements files to manage packages via. conda for running the training code and to develop on the project. A developer would need to first clone the repository and then pip install both the "requirements.txt" and "requirements_dev.txt". In the readme, there is a step-by-step instruction for running the code, consisting of installing invoke and invoking a "Create environment"-task and "Install requirements"-task. This installs both requirements files. Hereafter one needs to run "pre-commit install" to activate pre-commits. Furthermore, we have also created docker images with docker files that are deployed in the cloud, which enables a consistent and reproducible environment for all developers. In these docker files the environments are also setup uding the requirements files. Setting it up like this ensure that environments on different computers/setups are identical, reducing the chance of issures related to specific package versions etc.

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
>
> Answer:

We used most of the cookiecutter template. The nlp-model-specific code including data preprocessing, training and visualizations are in the src/nlp folder. The only folder we have removed is the notebooks folder. We have extended the config implementation to have several config files for different experiments, one that runs a simple fast experiment (exp1) and one that runs a hyperparameter tuning sweep of the model parameters (exp2). Furthermore, as data version control we save a data_config file with our preprocessed data to always be sure what data we are using for specific experiments in regards to the seed and size. There are some API-specific files that we had added because the intention was to use them for deploying the model using the API - but because of a lot of debugging in the cloud we did not manage to get this far with our project setup, meaning that these files are empty.

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,**
> **explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These*
> *concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...*
>
> Answer:

We implemented a pre-commit hook that automatically run the linting step ruff --fix and ruff --formatter before comitting any code. We thought it was a nice thing to introduce in a precommit to ensure that all code pushed to the repo in would be nicely formatted following best practice linting rules. By using linting rules at the pre-commit stage, you ensure that all developers adhere to the same coding standards before code is committed. This maintains a consistent codebase and reduces the load on the CI system. 
We tried implementing typing to every fuction on our own, however a better practice than that would be to use a package like mypy for static type checking. This helps catch type-related errors early and improves code readability and maintainability. We have looked into using the MKdocs to create documentation for the project. We did not manage to make it work within the time-frame, however this is really important to have when working on larger project for knowledge sharing, onboarding of new employees, consistecy and maintanance among other things.

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

We implemented 5 tests for data.py that primarily test the initialization of the datasets, ensuring that the train, validation, and test datasets are correctly populated and that the embeddings have size 768 and labels meet the expected criteria being 0 or 1. Additionally we implemented a test for model.py that verifys the input and output dimensions of the forwad passes.

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If your code had a code coverage of 100% (or close**

>
> Answer:

--- question 8 fill here ---

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

We used branches and pull requests extensively. Since we worked concurrently on the project we created separate branches for coding different sections of the project. We had one branch called development, and then treated our main branch as the production branch. When a branch for development was done and tested, we merged it into main. This made it possible for us to always have working code even when fixing multiple issues at the same time. We opened new branches for new features being developed such as visulization add ons, dockerimagebuild and report writing - just to mention a few of the examples. Furthermore, if issues arose we could go back to a previous version where the code was running seamlessly.

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*
>
> Answer:

--- <span style="color: red;"> We used a sort of "homemade" DVC. We trained on subsets of the dataset and kept track on which data was being used by tracking the size and seed used to extract the subset. Our data pipeline included preprocessing the data and saving these embeddings along with a data_config.yaml file tracking the size and seed. This way we can skip preprocessing every time if the consequtive trainings use the same data set. If we did not do this, there would be no way to reproduce a training and the results of the project would be unreliable. </span> ---

### Question 11

> **Discuss you continuous integration setup. What kind of continuous integration are you running (unittesting,**
> **linting, etc.)? Do you test multiple operating systems, Python  version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free**
> **to insert a link to one of your GitHub actions workflow.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 200-300 words.
>
> Example:
> *We have organized our continuous integration into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing*
> *and one for running ... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen*
> *here: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

For our continuous integration setup we have, as previously also described, a pre-commit-hook that check the following linting steps before comitting: trailing-whitespace, end-of-file-fixer, check-yaml, check-added-large-files, ruff-fix and ruff-format. This is done every time a commit added to the main branch. Besides this we have made a unittest workflow that runs the unit-tests on three different operating systems and two different python versions. Besides this, we have made a unittest workflow that runs the unit tests on three different operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu) and two different Python versions (3.11 and 3.12). This ensures that our code is compatible across multiple environments. We also use caching to speed up our CI workflows. For eksample, we cache the dependencies installed via pip to avoid re-downloading them on every run. A successful run can be seen [here](https://github.com/KarolineKlan/mlops_nlp/actions/runs/12930549267).
Additionally we have setup a trigger in the cloud that when pushing something to the main branch it automatically builds a new docker image in the artifact registry. 
Lastly the dependabot.yaml file configures Dependabot to automatically check for updates to Python dependencies managed by pip and GitHub Actions workflows. It is set to run these checks monthly and will create pull requests for any update it finds. This helps ensure that your project dependencies remain up to date and secure.

## Running code and tracking experiments

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
> especially the reproducibility of your experiments.

### Question 12

> **How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would**
> **run a experiment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: Python  my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25*
>
> Answer:

 We use hydra to parse a config file into a training function. The config files are located in a configs folder and contain an overall config file and several experiment config files. Depending on an experiment argument parsed in the command line the appropriate experiment configurations are loaded. An example usage is:
```invoke train``` which runs a simple experiment using the excact specified hyper-parameters in exp1.yaml file. Running the command```invoke train --experiment=exp2``` will run an experiment doing hyper-parameter sweep on W&B.

### Question 13

> **Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information**
> **is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment*
> *one would have to do ...*
>
> Answer:

The config is always passed to weights and biases project and is saved with each run. So we can always see exaclty which hyperparameters and data configurations produced the experiment results by inspecting the wandb run. To reproduce the experiment one would have to copy the configurations into a config file in the configs/experiment folder and call the experiment when invoking the training. Additionally a seed should always be set in order to ensure that any random processes are reproducible.
We also save the preprocessed data along with a data_config.yaml file that tracks the size and seed used. This way, we can skip preprocessing if consecutive trainings use the same dataset, ensuring that the same data is used acrosss different runs. This setup ensures that no information is lost and that experiments can be reliably reproduced.

### Question 14

> **Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&B (or another experiment tracking**
> **service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take**
> **inspiration from [this figure](figures/wandb.png). Explain what metrics you are tracking and why they are**
